## About Me

I am a game designer with 3+ years of experience using Unreal Engine. I specialize in technical combat design and possess a great aptitude for coding and designing fast-paced and intense gameplay. 

I am deeply passionate in creating intricate and intuitive mechanics that enable the player to experience an exciting and new way to combat enemies. I strive to follow best programming practices that allow for scalable and modular code so that it is easier to collbaorate with others, even though the project may be a solo endeavour! 

I have extensive knowledge using some of the latest tools and frameworks, including Perforce Version Control and Gameplay Ability System to name a few.

Currently, I am developing [From The Ashes: Reborn](http://convergentdreamsgames.itch.io/from-the-ashes-reborn), a third-person hack-and-slash game built in Unreal Engine 5.
