I am a game designer with 3+ years of experience using Unreal Engine. I specialize in technical combat design and possess a great aptitude for coding and designing fast-paced and intense gameplay.

I am deeply passionate in creating deepy intricate mechanics that enable the player to experience an exciting and new way to combat. I have extensive knowledge using some of the latest tools and frameworks, including Perfoce Version Control and Gameplay Ability System to name a few.

I am currently developing [From The Ashes: Reborn](http://convergentdreamsgames.itch.io/) - a 3rd person hack n' slash game in Unreal Engine 5.
